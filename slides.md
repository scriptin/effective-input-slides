# Effective Input for Language Acquisition

What makes "comprehensible input" method effective and efficient?

---

## Stephen Krashen's hypotheses

### Input hypothesis

> Learners progress in their knowledge of the language when they comprehend 
> language input that is slightly more advanced than their current level. 
> Krashen called this level of input "i+1", where "i" is the learner's 
> interlanguage and "+1" is the next stage of language acquisition.

### Acquisitionâ€“learning hypothesis

> There is a strict separation between (subconscious) acquisition 
> and (conscious, explicit) learning; Krashen claimed that improvement 
> in language ability was only dependent upon acquisition and never on learning.

### Monitor hypothesis (...)

### Natural order hypothesis (...)

### Affective filter hypothesis (...)

## Comprehensible input method

- Watching videos in your target language,
- Listening to podcasts,
- Reading books, etc.

---

## Limitations

Language skills classification:

- **Recognition**: ability to comprehend spoken and written langauge.
- **Production**: speaking and writing.
- **Translation/interpretation**, etc.

### Comprehensible input focuses on recognition

Production skills will still develop passively, lagging behind recognition skills.

---

## Importance of recognition skills

- In the beginning, flawless grammar is not that important.
- Comprehension is more important than speaking.
- Vocabulary is important at any level.
- Best way to develop passive vocabulary is input.

## Traits of Effective Input

- (Partially) comprehensible
- Compelling
- Challenging
- High volume
- Repetitive (in various contexts)
- Multi-modal
- Consistent practice

## Traits of Effective Input

### (Partially) comprehensible

- Directly: you understand the language.
- Indirectly, via a side-channel: you understand the context.

#### How much should I understand?

- I can't give you an exact number.
- The more you understand, the easier it is.
- Sometimes easy is good.
- Challenging yourself is required to progress.

---

## Traits of Effective Input

### Compelling

- Fun, enjoyable
- Very important, interesting

---

## Traits of Effective Input

### Challenging

- Not easy
- Not too hard

My problem with many apps for language learning: **"too easy!"**

---

## Traits of Effective Input

### High volume

- Hundreds of hours for languages similar to ones you already know.
- Thousands of hours for dissimilar languages.

#### My experience

- ~8-12 months of English -> from B1 to C1.
- 1 year of Spanish (300-500 hours) -> B1 in tests, B2 in comprehension.
- 300 hours of German -> A1/A2 level.

(Levels are in Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).)

## Traits of Effective Input

### Repetitive (in various contexts)

- Watching/listening/reading similar material improves comprehensibility.
- Doesn't mean you need to consume the same content over and over.

Examples:

- Reading book series (e.g. Harry Potter).
- Watching the same YouTube channel for a long time.

#### Spaced repetition (SR) / flashcards

- You don't need SR apps (e.g. Anki) or flashcards for high-frequency vocabulary.
- Yet, SR works for many people - good addition to input.
- "Sentence mining" is better than just words.

---

## Traits of Effective Input

### Multi-modal

By "modalities" I mean:

- reading
- listening
- watching

Examples:

- Reading a book, then listening to its audiobook version.
- Watching a video with subtitles (not translated).

---

## Traits of Effective Input

### Consistent practice

- Acquiring a language = developing new habits.
- Make it a part of your life.
- Language is not a trophy, it's a tool.
- 1 hour per day is better than 10 hours once a week.

---

## Summary

- (Partially) comprehensible
- Compelling
- Challenging
- High volume
- Repetitive (in various contexts)
- Multi-modal
- Consistent practice

Input should be your priority:
- especially when you start.
- throughout your journey.
