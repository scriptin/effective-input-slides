# Effective Input for Language Acquisition

What makes "comprehensible input" method effective and efficient?

---

## Stephen Krashen's hypotheses

- **Input hypothesis**: learners progress in their knowledge of the language when they comprehend language input that is slightly more advanced than their current level. Krashen called this level of input "i+1", where "i" is the learner's interlanguage and "+1" is the next stage of language acquisition.
- **Acquisitionâ€“learning hypothesis**: there is a strict separation between (subconscious) acquisition and (conscious, explicit) learning; Krashen claimed that improvement in language ability was only dependent upon acquisition and never on learning.
- **Monitor hypothesis**: consciously learned language can only be used to monitor language output, but never the source of spontaneous speech.
- **Natural order hypothesis**: language is acquired in a particular order, and that this order does not change between learners, and is not affected by explicit instruction.
- **Affective filter hypothesis**: learners' ability to acquire language is constrained if they are experiencing negative emotions such as fear or embarrassment.

### Corollaries

- Talking (output) is not practicing.
- When enough comprehensible input is provided, i+1 is present.
- The teaching order is not based on the natural order.

## Comprehensible input method

- Watching vidoes in your target languages.
- Listening to podcasts...
- Reading books...

---

## A big limitation

Language skills classification:

- **Recognition**: ability to comprehend spoken and written langauge
- **Production**: speaking and writing
- **Translation/interpretation**

### Comprehensible input focuses on recognition

Production skills will still develop passively, lagging behind recognition skills.

---

## Importance of recognition skills

- In most cases, flawless grammar is not that important.
- Comprehension is more important than speaking.
- Best way to develop passive vocabulary is input.

---

## Traits of Effective Input

- (Partially) comprehensible
- Compelling
- Challenging
- High volume
- Repetitive (in different contexts)
- Multi-modal
- Consistent practice

## Traits of Effective Input

### (Partially) comprehensible

- Directly: you understand the language
- Indereclty, via a side-channel: you understand the context

How much should I understand?

- I can't give you an exact number.
- The more you understand, the easier it is.
- Sometimes easy is good.
- Challanging yourself is required to progress.

---

## Traits of Effective Input

### Compelling

- Fun, enjoyable
- Very important, interesting

---

## Traits of Effective Input

### Challenging

- Not easy
- Not too hard

My problem with many apps for language learning: **too easy!**
---

## Traits of Effective Input

### High volume

- Hundreds of hours for languages similar to ones you already know
- Thousands of hours for dissimilar languages

#### My experience

- ~8-12 months of English -> from B1 to C1
- 1 year of Spanish (300-500 hours) -> B1 in tests, B2 in comprehension
- 300 hours of German -> A1/A2 level

---

## Traits of Effective Input

### Repetitive (in different contexts)

- Watching/listening/reading similar material improves comprehesibility.
- Doesn't mean you need to consume the same content over and over.

Examples:

- Reading book series (e.g. Harry Potter)
- Watching the same YouTube channel

#### Spaced repetition

- You don't need SRS (Anki, etc.) for high-frequency vocabulary.
- Yet, SRS works for many people - good addition to input.
- Sentence mining is better that just words.

---

## Traits of Effective Input

### Multi-modal

Watching, reading, and listening the same material (at the same time or separately).

Examples:

- Reading a book, than listening to its audiobook version.
- Watching a video with subtitles (not translated).

---

## Traits of Effective Input

### Consistent practice

- Acquiring a language = developing new habits.
- Make it a part of your life.
- Your target language must become a part of your life.
- 1 hours per day is better than 10 hours once a week.

---

## Closing thoughts

- Input should be your priority
  - especially when you start
  - throughout your journey
- It has limitations:
  - to get good at speaking and writing, you'll have to practice those

### Thanks for watching!
